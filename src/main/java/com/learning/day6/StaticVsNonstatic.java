//	   Static members(attributes and methods) can only be accessed by Class reference.
//     static members can only be changed or called using static members.



    // Keyword called "this"

    // this keyword refers to the current Object(itself) in a method or constructor.
    // -> this is used to eliminate the confusion between attributes and parameters with the same name.
